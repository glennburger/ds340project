To view my code, run the Jupyter_Project.ipynb file.

Within this file, I have modularized the code into multiple blocks, however the final block, when run, is the combination of all previous blocks. This is the code block that I recommend is run.

The code will take a long time to run. It is parameter tuning the adversarial attack, and as such, is looking for the best outcome out of many, many possibilites.

There is no need to download data--the code written by the original researchers pulls the MNIST data from the internet. Thus, the dataset is provided within the code.
